# #Calculate the total amount of tracer in old ECOM-si Mass Bay runs
# Mike Mickelson wanted to how the total mass of effluent within Mass Bay differs between the four scenarios of stratification and outfall location in this report:
# [Section 5: Effluent Dilution Simulations in Massachusetts Bay: An Evaluation of Relocating Greater Bostonâ€™s Sewage Outfall](http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2007/1302/sections/CIRC1302_Section5.SewageOutfall.pdf)
# 
# So I found the old netCDF files, updated them to be CF-Compliant, put them on our THREDDS server, and this notebook computes the amount of tracer in each of the 4 seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall) for both the Boston Harbor outfall location and the Mass Bay location
